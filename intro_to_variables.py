#Intro to variables

#Variables are abstract storage locations we associate with a name

food =  'Tacos'
name = 'Rattana'

print(food)
print( 'My name is:', name)

#Dynamic trping means variables can be reassigned
food = 'Pizza'
print(food)

#Execution flow is down the page meaning things below will eventually take priority
name = 'Travis'

#Multiple Assignment

first, middle, last = 'Dylan', 'Michael', 'Katina'

print(middle)

#naming convention in Python

#Variables use: snake-case (lowercase, words seperated by _ not spaces)
favorite_food = 'Tiramisu'
coding_temple= 'A great place to learn!'

#Constant variables (whos value will never change) (capital SNAKE_CASE)
NUM_PI = 3.14


#RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

#---- Don't start your variables with a number
# 1st_num = 1
num_1 = 1

#---- snake_case (words seperated by _)
# this var = 'Pizza'

#---- no symbols in you var names
# jack&jill = 'Run up the hill'
jack_and_jill = 'early in the morning'
